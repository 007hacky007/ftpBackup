# ftpBackup
Perl FTP backup script

This is quite old code (actually it dates back to ~2011), it was my first attempt to use perl 
so accept my apologies for all the dirtiness you find. 

We used this code on our Kimsufi (OVH) server - we had some FTP space on the backup server and 
this is how we used it.
